NanoCorruption:

Goal: A fun-sized machine for more game-like hacking operations.

The machine is a balanced ternary computer operating entirely on trytes.

Trytes range in value from -9841 to 9841.
A tryte is composed of 9 balanced ternary digits, called trits.
Each trit has a value (-1 or T, 0, 1), meaning base conversions look like:

    00010T001 == 1 * 3^5 + (-1) * 3^3 + 1 * 3^0 == 217

See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balanced_ternary for more information.

Three trits (a tribble) can be written in balanced septemvigesimal notation
(A..M_N..Z) (alphabet plus space/underscore in the middle: A=-13, _=0, Z=13).
Balanced septemvigesimal is written 0sA_Z, and trinary as #t00010T001.

The memory is 3^9=19683 trytes. All machine state is stored directly in memory.
Registers are stored in memory from 0s__A to 0s__Z.

The machine code is based on tribbles, and aims at being directly human readable.

Examples:
`AXY` means `X = X + Y`
`NB_AAA` means `B = B and 0sAAA`
`SBBNAA` means `B = B - AA`

Addressing:
Some tribbles are reserved to indicate special addressing modes.
  _:     immediate: read next tryte for literal value
  M:     memory: read next tryte for operand location
  O:     offset: read next tryte for for register and 2-tribble offset
      `MAOS_N` means `A = *(S+1)`

else:  operand is a register

2 operand instructions:
A: Add
S: Subtract
M: Move
P: Product (Multiply)
B: Both (And)
Y: anY (Or)

Rab: read memory address b into a
Wab: write value b into memory at a

Uab: Push: increment a, then write value b into memory address a
Oab: Pop: read memory address b into a, then decrement b
Cab: Call: Write PC to a, set PC to b
  Ex: CS_ABC ; call routine at #ABC (with stack pointer S)
      OPS    ; return (pop S into Program Counter)

Specials:

Iar: add Immediate: add the literal value of r to a
   IAN -- add 1 (0sN) to A

Jumps:
Jrr: Jump relative (Literal value of r, PC += r)
    J_N: skip 1 instruction

Conditional predicates:

Gab: Execute if a>=b
Lab: Execute if a<b
Eab: Execute if a==b
Nab: Execute if a!=b

These skip a full instruction, not one tryte.
  `NAA MAOS_N AAB` executes AAB, not S_N

Reserved registers:
P = Program Counter,
Z = #s___ (zero), always.

Unused opcodes:
