NanoCorruption:

Goal: A fun-sized machine for more game-like hacking operations.

The CPU is a balanced ternary computer operating entirely on trytes.

Trytes range in value from -364 to 364. 
A tryte is composed of 6 balanced ternary digits, called trits. 
Each trit has a value (-1, 0, 1), meaning base conversions look like:

	+0-00+ == 1 * 3^5 + (-1) * 3^3 + 1 * 3^0 == 217

Two trits can written with balanced nonary (DCBA0123, with D being equal to -3),
or three trits (a tribble) in balanced septemvigesimal notation (A..M_N..Z) 
(alphabet plus space/underscore in the middle, with A being -13).

The memory is 729 trytes. All machine state is stored directly in memory. 
Trytes on the zeroth row (0s_A-0s_Z) are 'registers', and more efficient to use
in machine code.

The machine code is based on tribbles, and aims at being directly human readable.

Examples:
`AXYZ` means `X = Y + Z`
`NBB_AA` means `B = B and 0sAA`
`SBBNAA` means `B = B - AA`

Addressing:
Some tribbles are reserved to indicate special addressing modes.
_:     immediate: read next tryte for literal value
N:     absolute: read next tryte for operand location
else:  operand is a register

3 operand instructions:
A: Add
S: Sub
N: And
E: Or (Either)
Wabc:  Write a to b+c
Rabc:  Read b+c to a

1 operand instructions:
P: Push
O: Pop
X: Swap tribble
C: Call
Z: Zero reg
I: Increment
D: Decrement

Jump:
J_## : Jump absolute
Jr : Jump relative 

Conditional:
Lrab : Jump if a<=b
Qrab : Jump if a==b 

Other:
T: Tritwise logical (+ word for operation)
Performs one of the 729 commutative ternary logical operations.

LabcOO -- perform logic operation OO performed on b and c, store to a.
		  Each trit of OO describes the result of one combination of operands:
		  --, -0, -+, 00, 0+, ++

Reserved registers:
P = PC,
S = Stack,
Z = 0s00, always.

Cycle counts:
Every read or write costs one cycle, except for reserved registers, which are free.
IA is 3 cycles: read `IA`, read `A`, write `A`.

Unused opcodes:
B
F
G
H
K
M
_
U
V
Y

Unresolved:
More useful operations? Flag register (maybe _)? Better conditional jumps?
